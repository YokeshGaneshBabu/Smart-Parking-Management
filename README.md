# Smart Parking Management System using IoT and Arduino

## Introduction

Welcome to the Smart Parking Management System GitHub repository! This project aims to simplify parking availability using IoT and Arduino technology. The system utilizes 6 IR sensors to monitor parking slots, an LCD display with I2C module for real-time slot information, a servo motor as a barricade, and LEDs to assist drivers in identifying vacant spots.

## ðŸš§ Under Construction ðŸš§

**Note:** This project is still under active development. We appreciate your interest and encourage you to check back for updates. Contributions and suggestions are welcome as we work towards making the Project even more efficient and user-friendly.

## Features

- **IR Sensors:** 6 infrared sensors are used to detect the occupancy status of parking slots.
- **LCD Display:** An LCD display with I2C module provides real-time information about available slots and displays a welcome message upon entry and a thank you message upon exit.
- **Servo Motor:** A servo motor acts as a barricade to control access to the parking area.
- **LEDs:** LEDs are strategically placed to assist drivers in identifying vacant parking spots easily.
- **Parking Slot Count:** The system displays the count of available parking slots at the entry point.
